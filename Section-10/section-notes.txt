- What is Object-oriented Programming(OOP)?
    - Work with real-life entities in your code

- Defining & Using a First Class
    - Objects
        - The things you work with in code
        - Instances of classes(= based on classes)
        - Class-based creation is an alternative to using object literals
    
    - classes
        - Blueprints for objects(theoretical definition)
        - Define how objects look like, which properties and methods they have
        - Classes make creation of multiple, similar objects much easier
    
- Static Methods & Properties
    - Static Field / Property / Method
        - Defined with 'static' keyword
        - Only accessible on class itself, without instantiation (i.e. not on instance)
        - Typically used in helper classes, global configuration etc.

    - Instance Field / Property / Method
        - Defined without static keyword
        - Only accessible on instances (= objects) based on class
        - Used for core, re-usable logic
